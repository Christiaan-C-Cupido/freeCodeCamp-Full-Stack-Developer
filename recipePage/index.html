    <h1>Easy Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
    <p>In this super simple egg fried rice recipe we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Coles Long Grain White Rice</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly whisked</li>
        <li>2 bacon rashers, chopped</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>2 shallots, trimmed, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds, to serve</li>
        <li>Shallots, sliced, extra, to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice in a large saucepan of boiling water for 12 minutes or until tender. Drain and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in non-stick wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add eggs. Swirl over base to form an omelette. Cook for 2 minutes or until set. Transfer to a chopping board. Set aside to cool slightly. Roll up and thickly slice.</li>
        <li>Add bacon to wok. Cook 4 minutes until light golden. Add carrot. Stir fry 1 minute. Add shallots, peas and rice. Cook, stirring, 3-4 minutes. Add egg and soy sauce. Stir until heated through. Sprinkle with sesame seeds and top with extra shallots. Serve immediately.</li>
        <li>When cooking the rice, it’s best to use the boiling method instead of the absorption method so the rice grains can remain separated. For the best results, it’s also ideal to use cooled or chilled rice, which is why I often make it the day before. Once it’s cooled, simply spread out onto a tray, cover with plastic film and refrigerate until required.</li>
